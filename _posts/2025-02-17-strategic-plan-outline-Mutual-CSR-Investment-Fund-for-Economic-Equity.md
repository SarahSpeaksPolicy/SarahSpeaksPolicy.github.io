**Strategic Plan Outline – Mutual CSR Investment Fund for Economic
Equity**

**I. Executive Summary**

- Brief overview of the economic disparities in New Orleans and how
  fragmented CSR efforts lack scale & coordination.

- Introduction to the Mutual CSR Investment Fund model as a structured,
  pooled investment mechanism for workforce & small business
  development.

- Key goals: Scalability, sustainability, equity-focused impact.

**II. Problem Statement & Economic Disparity Analysis**

- **Current Landscape of Economic Disparities**

  - Workforce challenges in minority & underserved communities.

  - Small business barriers (lack of capital access, resources,
    mentorship).

  - Limitations of traditional CSR efforts—why one-off initiatives fail.

- **Why a Mutual Model?**

  - Need for a structured, pooled funding mechanism to scale impact.

  - Avoids duplication of efforts & inefficient spending.

  - Provides long-term, measurable investment rather than short-term
    charity.

**III. The Intersection of Economic Development & CSR**

- **How Traditional Economic Development Works →**

  - Usually led by government agencies, nonprofits, and policy
    incentives (i.e., tax breaks, grants, infrastructure investment).

  - Historically underutilized private sector participation beyond large
    corporations & anchor institutions.

- **The Role of CSR in Economic Development →**

  - CSR has expanded beyond traditional philanthropy into impact
    investing, sustainability initiatives, and DEI commitments.

  - Companies increasingly want measurable, systemic impact in their CSR
    initiatives.

  - Problem: Most CSR efforts lack coordination & scalability, leading
    to fragmented, short-term interventions.

- **Why a CSR Mutual Fund Model is the Missing Link →**

  - Pools resources to create sustained, high-impact investment in
    workforce development & minority business growth.

  - Allows companies of all sizes to participate, removing barriers for
    small & mid-sized businesses.

  - Bridges the gap between public economic development strategies &
    private CSR investment.

<!-- -->

- Possible partnerships with government agencies & foundations to expand
  reach.

**IV. Implementation Plan & Stakeholder Engagement**

- **Pilot Phase**

  - Launch in specific districts/neighborhoods with clear economic need.

  - Partner with local chambers of commerce & minority business
    associations.

- **Scaling the Model**

  - Expansion strategies for broader corporate engagement.

  - Integration with statewide & regional economic development efforts.

- **Success Metrics & Evaluation**

  - KPIs: Workforce placement rates, small business growth, reinvestment
    impact.

  - Transparency & Reporting: Annual impact assessments, public
    dashboards.

**V. Resources & Research Base**

- **Case Studies & Precedents**

  - Anchor institution models (Living Cities, JPMorgan Foundation, etc.)

  - Existing community development financial institutions (CDFIs) as a
    comparison.

- **Economic & Policy Reports**

  - Data on economic disparities & minority business challenges in New
    Orleans.

  - Policy analysis on CSR trends & impact investment.

- **Potential Partnerships**

  - Public Sector: City of New Orleans Economic Development, HUD.

  - Private Sector: Local businesses, banks, impact investors.

  - Nonprofits & Foundations: Organizations focusing on minority
    business development.

**VI. Conclusion**

- Why This Model Works → Scalable, sustainable, and designed for
  long-term impact.

- Call to Action → Next steps in implementation & corporate recruitment.
